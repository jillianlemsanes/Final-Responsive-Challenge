I decided to take a course on Responsive Web Layout created by a Youtuber and developer that has significantly helped me improve my CSS skills. This is the final project from the class to show case what I learned during this time.

# A few things a learned about responsive layouts:

1) Using widths as a percentage is much more responsive as it will grow and shrink with the different screen sizes.

2) Max-width is great to use on containers as they can help prevent side scrolling which breaks responsive design.

3) Always using pixels is not a good idea for responsive design. Using values like rem, em, and percent will help you out with responsive design.

4) I learned to build out the HTML to suit your desktop design first, as usually this will be a more complicated design that you will need to build your HTML to support. Then you build out the mobile design in CSS first.

5) I used my first media query. I hadn't used this property yet and had no idea what they meant. I can confidently say I know how to use a media query now, which is key to responsive websites!

6) Generally, using a height to style will make things unresponsive, although they are good to use in some circumstances.

# Some things I struggled with:

1) Mainly the navigation bar! Throughout the entire class, this is something that was hard for me to remember how to do. I kept forgetting the tricks to getting the nav bar to work properly. Mobile nav bars were specifically hard for me since I added on the hamburger menu. I do not know JavaScript as of now, so I had to use all CSS and HTML.

My solution to the nav bar problem:

- I found a Youtube video that walked me through how to do the nav bar, although it used CSS Grid. I haven't used Grid very much yet, so decided to switch the menu over to Flexbox so I wasn't just copying and pasting. I wanted to still actively learn. This part was challenging but I was proud that I could convert the tutorial to Flexbox on my own.

These are a few highlights and struggles, although I could go on and on about smaller things I learned and things I didn't know. I still have so much to learn about web design and creating an amazing website, as coding is a never ending learning journey. I CAN say that this course helped me plant a firm first foot on this journey.
